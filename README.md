# Business Problem Summary & Project Objective

Swire Coca-Cola is confronting challenges in optimizing production planning and inventory management for its innovative beverage products. Due to the uniqueness of these products, there isn't a direct historical sales match, which has led to issues with underestimating demand—resulting in missed revenue opportunities—and overproduction, causing product distress. The company aims to balance these extremes by accurately forecasting demand and identifying the most lucrative regions and times to launch these products.

The primary goals of the project are to accurately forecast weekly demand for seven innovative products, match these products with historical sales data, and determine the optimal regions and times for their launch. The project involves employing advanced forecasting methods such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, and validating these models through rigorous testing. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance revenue opportunities from these products while minimizing the risk of overproduction.

# Group's Solution

To tackle the business problem, our approach involves mapping the innovative products' attributes—such as flavor, category, and brand—to similar historical data to create a relevant dataset for analysis. We addressed and solved all seven cases provided, using a combination of time series forecasting models including Prophet, ARIMA, and SARIMA, tailored to the specific characteristics and seasonality of the beverage industry. Our strategy includes a thorough data preparation phase, addressing region-specific needs, and adjusting for any identified outliers or missing values. By doing so, we aim to provide Swire with a robust forecasting tool that optimizes production and inventory decisions, capitalizing on market opportunities effectively.

# Contribution to the Project

In an organized effort to address the project's requirements efficiently, we decided to allocate specific tasks per case among our team members. I personally took responsibility for the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of questions 2 and 6, delving into the data to uncover initial insights and patterns. For the modeling phase, I focused on questions 2, 6, and 7, applying sophisticated forecasting techniques to predict future demands effectively. Additionally, I contributed to the project by conducting a sentiment analysis on the Dreamworld and Starlight case studies. This analysis was aimed at bolstering a team member's proposal, providing valuable insights that enriched our collective understanding and strategic approach.

# Business Value of the Solution

At the outset of this project, we were tasked with addressing two critical business questions for Swire Coca-Cola: "How much should we make?" and "Should we make more?" Our team's comprehensive approach involved providing estimated and forecasted demand through various modeling techniques for all cases, enabling precise production planning. By quantifying expected demand, we could also calculate associated costs, such as potential overage and underage expenses, thus allowing Swire to understand the financial implications and risks involved.

Additionally, our findings included targeted location recommendations for launching new products, enhancing Swire's market entry strategies. As for the question of whether to produce more, we identified a significant opportunity to harness real-time data from online reviews and community discussions. This approach would provide ongoing insights into product performance, enabling Swire to recalibrate our models continually and make informed decisions about increasing production based on up-to-date consumer feedback and demand trends.

# Difficulties Encountered the Group Encountered

Throughout this project, our team faced several significant challenges due to the complexity and volume of the data involved. Initially, we attempted to apply a single model to address all the questions; however, this approach proved inefficient. The sheer size of the dataset exceeded normal computing capabilities, hindering our ability to manipulate the data effectively. This realization forced us to refine our strategy, leading us to select specific subsets of data tailored to each individual question, which significantly improved our handling and analysis efficiency.

Another challenge arose from the anonymization of the data. The dataset did not include real-world names or directly comparable terms for competitors, which initially set us back in our comparative analysis. This limitation required us to focus solely on the data provided without the ability to cross-reference external data sources or conduct broader competitive analyses. Despite these hurdles, our team adapted our methodologies to work within these constraints and still produce valuable insights for Swire Coca-Cola.
