# Business Problem Summary & Project Objective
Swire Coca-Cola is confronting challenges in optimizing production planning and inventory management for its innovative beverage products. Due to the uniqueness of these products, there isn't a direct historical sales match, which has led to issues with underestimating demand—resulting in missed revenue opportunities—and overproduction, causing product distress. The company aims to balance these extremes by accurately forecasting demand and identifying the most lucrative regions and times to launch these products.

The primary goals of the project are to accurately forecast weekly demand for seven innovative products, match these products with historical sales data, and determine the optimal regions and times for their launch. The project involves employing advanced forecasting methods such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet, and validating these models through rigorous testing. Ultimately, the project aims to enhance revenue opportunities from these products while minimizing the risk of overproduction.

# Group's Solution
To tackle the business problem, our approach involves mapping the innovative products' attributes—such as flavor, category, and brand—to similar historical data to create a relevant dataset for analysis. We will use a combination of time series forecasting models including Prophet, ARIMA, and SARIMA, tailored to the specific characteristics and seasonality of the beverage industry. Our strategy includes a thorough data preparation phase, addressing region-specific needs, and adjusting for any identified outliers or missing values. By doing so, we aim to provide Swire with a robust forecasting tool that optimizes production and inventory decisions, capitalizing on market opportunities effectively.
